# Early Intervention Services

## Introduction

Early Intervention Services are specialized support programs designed for children from birth to six years of age who have developmental delays or are at risk of developing them. These services aim to enhance a child's development, minimize developmental delays, and provide families with the necessary tools and support to help their children thrive.

Our center offers comprehensive early intervention services across four key developmental areas:

## Cognitive Intervention

### Overview

Cognitive Early Intervention (ITC) focuses on enhancing cognitive, emotional, and social development in children under six years old. This area of intervention is crucial as it targets the development of essential cognitive skills like memory, attention, problem-solving, and logical reasoning.

### Services for Children

- **Stimulation Sessions**: Age-appropriate activities including thematic puzzles, classification exercises, and memory games designed to enhance cognitive skills.
- **Intervention for Children with Intellectual Disabilities**: Specialized programs that adapt cognitive stimulation to each child's specific needs and abilities.
- **Activities for Children with High Abilities**: Enrichment programs that challenge and nurture the potential of gifted children through complex problem-solving activities.

### Services for Families

- **Training Courses**: Educational sessions that provide families with strategies to support cognitive development at home.
- **Support for Families of Children with Disabilities**: Specialized guidance on adapting activities and creating supportive home environments.
- **Resources for Families of Children with High Abilities**: Tools and strategies to nurture and challenge gifted children appropriately.

### Services for Educators

- **Professional Development**: Training programs that equip educators with evidence-based strategies for cognitive stimulation in classroom settings.
- **Consultation Services**: Expert guidance on adapting curriculum and activities for children with diverse cognitive needs.

## Linguistic Intervention

### Overview

Linguistic Early Intervention focuses on detecting, evaluating, and treating potential alterations in language development in children under 6 years. This intervention is vital due to the brain's high plasticity during early years, which allows for greater adaptation and recovery when facing linguistic difficulties.

### Services for Children

- **Stimulation Sessions**: Activities like "What Sound Is It?" for auditory discrimination and phonetic articulation, and "The Word Market" role-play games to promote social interaction and language use in everyday contexts.
- **Intervention for Children with Language Problems**: Specialized sessions like "The Vowel Wheel" to reinforce vowel identification and promote collaboration among children with language difficulties.

### Services for Families

- **Training Courses**: "Brain and Words: Keys to Stimulate Speech in Early Years" provides information about brain plasticity and activity in early ages, and "From Words to Stories: Stimulating Narrative Language at Home" offers activities to strengthen linguistic development.
- **Courses for Families of Children with Language Problems**: "Communicating Without Barriers" program provides information about speech therapy intervention and functional exercises for children with language disorders.

### Services for Educators

- **Training for Stimulating Development**: "Oral Language Stimulation in Early Care" course teaches educators to promote language prerequisites and prevent future alterations, and "Early Intervention for Language and Speech Development" provides tools to improve communication skills in children aged 0-5.
- **Training for Teachers of Children with Language Problems**: "Intervention Program for Stimulation and Prevention of Oral Language Difficulties in Early Childhood Education" offers theoretical foundations and inclusive teaching proposals with practical materials.

## Prenatal Intervention

### Overview

Prenatal Early Intervention encompasses activities performed before birth to promote the baby's integral development. This includes auditory, tactile, motor, and visual stimulation aimed at enhancing cognitive, emotional, and sensory development of the fetus while establishing affective communication between the unborn baby and parents.

### Services for Pregnant Women

- **Prenatal Stimulation Sessions**: Informative sessions about healthy habits during pregnancy, psychoeducation workshops for emotional support, relaxation techniques and yoga exercises, and sensory stimulation activities for the fetus (auditory and tactile).
- **Stimulation for High-Risk Pregnancies**: Specialized programs with detailed evaluation and individualized plans for mothers with high-risk pregnancies, including adapted sensory stimulation techniques.

### Services for Families

- **Training Courses for Expectant Couples**: Programs to help partners learn how to care for the mother's physical, mental, and emotional needs, including practical support in daily life, emotional care, and preparation for childbirth.
- **Training for Extended Family Members**: Psychoeducational talks about the importance of family support during pregnancy, emotional support and counseling, communication tools development, and guidance on creating a favorable sensory environment at home.

## Sensorimotor Intervention

### Overview

Sensorimotor Early Intervention is a therapeutic approach for infants and children with difficulties in sensory processing and motor development. This intervention is based on the premise that early years are essential for brain development due to high neuronal plasticity, making it crucial to address sensory perception and motor skill alterations as early as possible.

### Services for Children

- **Sensorimotor Stimulation for Children Under 12**: Activities including tactile stimulation games with various textures, visual and auditory stimulation exercises, movement and balance therapy with swings and therapeutic balls, and proprioception games involving heavy objects and movement.
- **Intervention for Children with Functional Diversity**: Specialized programs for children with motor, auditory, or visual deficits, with personalized intervention plans developed by a multidisciplinary team after thorough assessment.

### Services for Families

- **Family School - Home Sensorimotor Stimulation**: Training sessions for families to apply sensory stimulation strategies at home, with workshops led by psychopedagogy and occupational therapy professionals.
- **Guidance for Families of Children with Functional Diversity**: Psychoeducation services providing tools and emotional support for families to understand their children's needs and promote their autonomy and communication.

### Services for Educational Centers

- **Student Sensorimotor Assessment**: Screening services using the Battelle Developmental Inventory to evaluate muscular control, body coordination, locomotion, fine motor skills, and perceptual motor skills.
- **Guidance for Teachers on Functional Diversity**: Training sessions, didactic materials, and resources to support the implementation of sensorimotor strategies in the classroom, with periodic evaluations to monitor student progress.
